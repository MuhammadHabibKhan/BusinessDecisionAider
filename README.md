2nd Semester Project. Adaptive GUI based on user input built using Tkinter. Based on Linear Algebra and calculates the maximization of profit or minimization of cost based on parameters entered by the user.
Not fully functional. Development halted. Might build it again using new technologies and concepts I learned.
